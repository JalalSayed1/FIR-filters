# FIR Filters

## Introduction
In this assignment, we focus on signal processing in electrocardiogram (ECG) using the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering method, where the impulse response is for a finite ratio. This is a causal signal processing method where the system processes the incoming signal in real-time, ideally with negligible latency, instead of requiring the complete sample to be processed. An adaptive FIR Least Mean Squares (LMS) filter is also used to make the FIR filter adaptive by changing the coefficients and learning the optimal filter coefficients over time. A matched filter is also written to detect the R-peaks signal for a noisy ECG.
